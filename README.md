First project from General Assembly: is a Tic-Tac-Toe game, two players play against each-other. The player wins by playing three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

A draw is made if the board is filled and no matches are made.



###### Main features:

* players can add their name and choose their symbols
* the game

###### Bugs:

* Draw function seems to break the X/O code.
* The CSS layout is not yet web responsive.


###### Languages used:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript/jQuery


###### What I learnt from this project:
* How to troubleshoot when a line of code doesn't work.
* Finding errors and understanding error messages.
* Testing out lines of code on the console to see if they work, so I don't go back and forth.
